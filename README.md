# Numerical Methods
<li>Writing function to calculate integral based on Mont carlo simulation</li>
<li>Writing function to solve system of equations, using LU factorization
  LU decomposition is a better way to implement Gauss elimination, especially for 
  repeated solving a number of equations with the same left-hand side.</li>
  <li>Solving nonlinear system of equations using newthon method</li>
