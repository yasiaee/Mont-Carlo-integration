# Numerical Methods
<li>1.Writing function to calculate integral based on Mont carlo simulation</li>
2.Writing function to solve system of equations, using LU factorization
  LU decomposition is a better way to implement Gauss elimination, especially for 
  repeated solving a number of equations with the same left-hand side.
